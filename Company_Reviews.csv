Ask two managers the same thing and you are likely to get two different answers. No consistency with scheduling or flexibility. Your experience with scheduling will depend on your manager. Some want you to be available when they say, regardless of your other obligations, while other managers have respect for work-life balance. In addition, there are way too many 12-hour shifts scheduled. This is unacceptable to me. 12-hour shifts should be reserved for those who volunteer and should be rewarded appropriately. If no-one steps up then figure something else out. Scheduling 12-hour shifts shows no regard to the employee.For the remote customer service position, we were trained for two weeks, which is sufficient. However, after that you are pretty much left to the wolves. They say you are free to ask questions, but everyone is literally ghost once you end training. They have a chat system that is for the birds! During training it seems great. However, you will ask a question once you are on ""the floor"" and will get crickets. You will ping a manager for help and get crickets! Then when you look up, the manager has logged out of the chat system. Really?!! So then your only resort is to email a manager and their response is that email is not a good way to get help. How the heck am I supposed to get help when a manager is not around to chat or they ignore my chats?? I understand that not all managers are available 24-7 but the ones that are need to respond. And I shouldn't be chastised for seeking other resources. I'm not sure what I expected, the team leads (most of them, not all) seem rather robotic and boring. Seems like they may not like their jobs, this would explain no one going out of their way to help.If you've been working low-paying jobs then you may put up with these issues, but this is really only a decent salary and I've made more than double what they in a previous career.

The drivers would also enjoy flexible hours and being a boss of his/her own (interestingly, this is consistently the #1 reason why drivers love Uber, at least from my personal experiences talking with dozens of drivers)2) The riders, by give them much better riding experiences (courteous and friendly driver, cleaner car, convenience in hailing a car, great customer service), as well as cheaper rides3) The society, by making more jobs (we are creating 50,000 jobs a month across the globe) and taking inefficiencies out of our economy4) The environment, by reducing the need of self-driving and car ownership, and encouraging ride sharing, Uber could make a potentially very large impact on our environment* Second reason why I love working for Uber are the people I work with.

From what I've seen, this is probably a function of startup style code trying to get features out the door, the large number of engineers at the company and lack of bureaucracy (empowerment applies equally regardless of skill level), and the small team oriented nature of the company built around services. While a service oriented architecture scales well and has a myriad of benefits, what no one seems to talk about that I've witnessed firsthand is that isolated services don't necessarily get the influence of some of the technically strongest people. Some services are incredibly well written, others will probably need to be rewritten before long.

C-level executives emphasize during the all-hands that they don't tolerate insensitive comments or behavior.Pros:- Lots of smart people; this can be intimidating but it means there's lots of opportunity to learn.- Great work, high impact. Even interns get important projects.- Professional demeanor. I don't see anyone playing political or social games. ""No jerks"" rule is emphasized from C-level down.- Meritocracy is practiced here. Everyone is expected to be responsible and be thorough at their tasks. The top coding bootcamp graduates are among the new hires. Degrees aren't mandatory. I see more women engineers here than I saw in college.- Most folks don't work crazy hours, including mid-level managers. Work-life balance is real here, unless you're unlucky (see cons).- Good locations; HQ buildings are near public transit.- Sane RSU policy for a pre-IPO company.

Vacation has to be approved by the manager, only employees have to figure out how much is the right amount.

When you are a new employee or a ""nUber"" as they call you, you are incessantly emailed by the HR, COO, etc. to leave a positive review on Glassdoor. Amazingly, after 3 months at the company the review requests suddenly dissipate. They know that after a while employees get jaded and no longer have positive things to say about Uber.Career Growth:- Little to no career growth opportunities for individuals on city teams - all roads lead to San Francisco- People Iäó»ve known who have moved to San Francisco have encountered similar political issues upon moving with minor cost of living adjustments to make up for the huge change in living expensesOffice Politics:- Suffocating amounts of office politics. You are judged more on how much people like you than the caliber of work you produce or how hard you work in general- Performance is very much weighted by how much others in the office like you- Individuals who have more tenure (pre-2015) are given favoritism- Despite being a cultural value, company has a huge problem with principled confrontation and toe-stepping, those who do well at Uber are consummate äóìyes-menäóLeadership:- Most leaders are inexperienced. Many have moved up in the ranks after being an early employee at Uber where Uber was their first or second job and have had little to know training or mentorship from managers that are actually good at being managers- Other leaders that have been hired-in are subject to the same popularity norms that plague office politics and are unlikely to stand up for their people if it means potentially being disliked- Massive pressure pushed down from C-level. Many higher level managers have enough problems managing up to Travis to effectively also manage their own teams. Although some genuinely care, many are only able to do the minimum.Attitude and Compensation:- Even with favoritism individuals with tenure are unhappy and jaded because they are compensated way below market value- Early employees who were lucky enough to have extreme successes early while riding the wave of tremendous growth often have confuse their luck with talent or experience; this is compounded by the amount of favoritism they receive- Early employees who have äóìgolden handcuffsäó because they cannot afford to buy out their options at current strike price often do very little and still receive good performance due to favoritism, this drags down motivations of others that are actually try to move the needle- Many leaders at the company often carelessly throw out that they can fire anyone, at any time for any reason which makes people feel concerned about their job security- With the way that the new Uber credits are structured, the perks of working for Uber are not what they used to be [for new employees]- 14 cultural values: many are duplicative, most are ignored and not one has anything to do with Integrity",25,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P89.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Nov 2, 2016","""Greenlight Manager""",5,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,"Amazing team that is super driven to succeedCompany mission - opportunity to create significant change for city landscapeActively help Uber partners get back on the road and provide an earning opportunity",Be prepared to work long hours,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P89.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Nov 2, 2016","""Don't work in the office!""",1,"Former Employee - Partner Support Representative in Honolulu, HI",Hourly pay.

You must be incredibly good at office politics to be successful - and in fact, if you are not good at politics, you can expect to be routinely passed on for projects and given low performance.#2 - Performance Policy - Stack ranking is a disaster as teams are compared against each other although they have very different KPIs. Additionally, some orgs have little control of the outcomes of their projects, but are judged by results rather than contribution. If everyone is good, some people still have to get low marks, where politics is particularly prominent.#3 - Work/Life Balance / Stress - Working at Uber is extremely stressful. Every decision you want to make is challenged thoroughly and rigorously and there are constantly people that are ""toe-stepping"" on you to ensure the best decision is made. While this is great for the company, on an individual level, it leads to very stressful situations where you must constantly prove everything you do and justify it.#4 - People Last Mentality - The company makes no secret from the CEO and down that everything it does should prioritize the company first, and the person later. HR has been neglected, with recruiters consistently overhyping potential compensation. New policies are constantly put in place that undermine the employee (e.g. changing an employee perk so that it is as underutilized as possible).#5 - Compensation & Hiring Process - Newer employers (2015+) are routinely under-compensated with potentially misleading guidance on the ""upside"" potential of a high valuation. Additionally, the hiring process takes too long (at times 3+ months ), and the recruiting team could be much more professional.

My direct manager has reached out to People Ops numerous times and cc'd me on each one to confirm this and have the transition. To this day, I have worked no less than 40 hours a week. Needless to say, they have completely forgotten about it and have not responded in well over a month. I have had to keep getting healthcare from the Healthcare Market. Every time we reach out to the department, we hear literally nothing back.This also translates into the soft benefits. I have received confirmation that my gym reimbursements were going to be coming in, however they have not been. I saved the contract and all the emails between People Ops and myself, sent this in, but as mentioned above, I have literally heard nothing back.There are also no opportunities to move up. Without hard data, everyone I've interacted with confirms that no one lasts here more than a year, maybe a year and a half.

The IC-level talent is phenomenal; you're working with bright engineers, designers, and data scientists who all have incredible drive and talent. It's a great place to grow and learn. This has been Uber's biggest value prop to technical members of staff to date, and it still holds true. You have the opportunity to work on world-class platforms and build product experiences from scratch, which is cool no matter how you slice it.Despite Uber's public woes, there's clearly an earnest effort by executive leadership to solve the company's cultural problems. Liane Hornsey has led a mighty effort to systematically address the many, many accumulated issues that Uber has accrued. Dara seems right-headed as well, and seems keen on addressing his (very accurate, I believe) read on the company's problems.The catered food is free and pretty great. There are some down days in quality, but anyone who says the food sucks is probably just accustomed to the likes of Google or Facebook's excellent free fare.","Managers who are supportive, proactive, and empathetic are unfortunately the exception, not the rule. I imagine some of this stems from scope problems (most managers simply have too many direct reports; my first had something near 20), but if you talk with engineers, there are a scant few who don't have a story about how their manager really let them down during a promotion cycle, review cycle, or project in a manner that was obscurantist at best or callous at worst.Teams often try to parallelize the product development cycle. This has repeatedly been the source of a lot of stress and thrashing on important projects. Engineers will be asked to work in parallel with product and design contributors, meaning that as the product design changes, engineers will need to follow along. It's often unclear when and how a design will change, or even whether it will change again; there's just not a good communication pipeline or standardized workflow on a number of teams.If you're an engineer, there's an immense onus placed on you to drive the success of your projects. Engineers are the last filter between a product's idea and its implementation, and so the responsibility falls on them to account for not only product edge cases, but gaps in design documentation (which is never formalized, and usually just a set of slides that requires a follow-up meeting or three to clarify), and team workflow.In short, the culture is that if anything gets in your way, if there's any blocker you hit, if anything at all is unclear, that is YOUR sole responsibility to surmount.

I am the newest employee in a Greenlight Hub location. I was a partner ""driver"" for Uber previously and really fell in love with the company and the platform. Now that I have been an employee of the company it has completely changed my outlook. I have been employed with Uber since July 27th 2017. Since my initial week of training off the floor, I have yet to receive any further training from any level of management. I have not and currently do not receive one on one training nor have I been coached or developed to pursue a career path within the company. I am however expected to produce positive metric without any additional training or support. There is no growth opportunity. I am not assigned projects or any special assignments that are outside of my normal job duties that would allow me to learn something new about company processes and procedures. Here in our Greenlight Hub it is a consistent issue to get a supervisor or manager to speak to a partner that is requesting to speak with a manager. I have heard multiple different things about company policy. For example, I was originally told that I could be negative forty hours for my vacation time and negative forty hours for sick time. I was just sent an email from my supervisor that I am almost negative forty for the year. I have a medical condition and need to see my doctor as often as once a week. If Iäó»m not able to take the time off that I need to use my benefits and take care of my personal health that ends up not being a perk working for Uber. . In the same email, I felt it was insinuated that I am abusing the sick time. I contacted my Greenlight Hub manager and told her I would be providing a doctoräó»s note for each approved sick time so that it is documented that I DID, in fact, have medical appointments and I am NOT abusing the companies sick time policy. I was then told by my supervisors that they didnt care what I use sick time for. ""If you want to go to Paris on sick time we dont care."" Is exactly what was said. Overall the Greenlight hub location where I work is a toxic work environment. My coworkers are discriminatory against me. I walk in the hub in the morning to music blasting that talks about women in a derogatory manner the music also says racial slurs. Very unprofessional. I walk over to a spot at the desk to set up my laptop for the day and I watch my coworkers converse amongst each other not to have anyone say good morning to me and have been blatantly ignored. For example, I came back from being out of the hub for 11 days and when I came back from vacation on the morning of 10/31/2017 not a single one of my coworkers said anything to me when I walked in as they all hung out with each other before we opened. When I talked to my supervisor about it, I asked her ""if she thought it was normal behavior to be out of the office for a week to then come back and not have anyone say anything to you?"" My supervisor would not answer my question. Another example is, I came in one morning and got my laptop set up, walked to the back office where two coworkers where sitting at a community table in the back office talking and eating breakfast. I asked if I could join them, One of my coworkers gave me nasty look and then continued her conversation with the other employee. I sat down at the table and was not acknowledge the rest of the time. I found out that there was a company paid employee outing that I was not even told about and just found out after it happened. Another coworker told me that she and a few other people were talking and that it wouldn't surprise them if I got promoted before anyone else because of my race. There are other grievances that I have with the company but the discrimination and hate that I walk into every day has affected my well-being and mental health to the point that I dread coming into work every day. It hurts to be treated the way that I have been.",3,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P171.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Nov 3, 2017","""Great Internship experience""",5,"Current Employee - Data Analyst Intern in Palo Alto, CA",Uber Benefits and fast paced work environment,Data can be more organized,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P171.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Nov 4, 2017","""Hustling!""",4,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,The pace and the level of ownership in and around work is high!

That said, the chill attitude can go too far at times and get projects in trouble. I won't say how many times I've had to work late or during the weekend to fix something that could have been prevented. Disorganization is chronic and people can be really cavalier about documentation. I guess outside of coders and engineers, there isn't a strong sense to write things down?

I met him recently and felt like he is really committed to changing things.I feel like I've put out a lot of fires in the last six months. We are growing fast which is great but my people are spread a little thin. Right now we are okay but for a while there we had some serious burnout to deal with. There are caveats to the unlimited vacation perk...I've seen a post passed around on LinkedIn where a guy complains about how Uber looks down on people without Ivy degrees.

The main reason being the very negative corporate culture and the poor people management skills of its top management.1) Uber is severely understaffed and desperately tries to get people in all areas - and it notably lacks good leaders. Traditionally Uber promotes purely based on operational results. Unfortunately, the best managers aren't necessarily the best leaders. My direct manager specifically was one of the worst people managers I've ever encountered throughout my career (although he apparently did bring in good results in his past role).2) Uber had to hire so fast that building a sustainable corporate culture hasn't been much of a priority. Uber naturally would argue otherwise not add a Mary of fact for anyone who had worked for a top company before (be it consulting, FMCG or tech) will be heavily disappointed by the lack of common spirit in the company. Some call Uber's culture toxic. I would rather consider that it lacks one altogether.2) Feedback is super unstructured. I personally am a strong believer that feedback is one of the best ways to learn and improve on a daily basis. Unfortunately, although Uber has a very extensive bi-annual feedback procedure it's not a very helpful one. Additionally, in my case my direct manager couldn't have cared less about providing feedback, even going as far as stating ""please do not ask me again for feedback outside the formal process"". That's an absolute no.go.3) Since feedback is unstructured, also performance reviews are very intransparent. The bonus (which makes a significant part of the salary) is distributed solely by the direct manager and does not necessarily have to be linked to the targets, since they are anyway moving all the time. That's a problem since it skews the bonus payments towards people who have been around the longest and is biased against new comers.4) Good leaders leave the company, the bad ones stay. Uber has seen an unbelievable amount of fluctuation in the past 12 months, both forced (= firing) as well us voluntary. On average a new hire only spends less than 2 years with Uber (that's significantly lower that with other Tech companies, such as Google, notably for senior positions). Additionally, people who leave very often have one thing in common: They are looking back with mixed and negative feelings. That's extremely sad, considering the fact that Uber is the only one of my previous employers I cannot warmly recommend to my network.5) Poor learning and development for General Managers. Most GMs are recruited from within. The few that come from outside, very often do not last long. The main reason is that Uber looks any sort of training and development for external people. And also Uber's new manager training is rather a joke compared to the state of the art L&D programs of other companies.",2,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P178.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Dec 1, 2017","""Finance Manager""",5,"Current Employee - Anonymous Employee in Sí£o Paulo, Sí£o Paulo (Brazil)","Company extremely driven to success, open minded, with strong but achievable goals.With a state of the art tech and IT team.

Perhaps it's given me valuable insight into what doesn't work.The company grew quickly and has reached a size, in my opinion, that isn't considered a ""start up"" anymore. However, the tenured folks there still had that ""move fast, break things"" mentality without realizing that now their mistakes have a cascading affect across 100s of people working in their org. I'd like to have seen more strategic and intentional decisions versus experiments (sometimes even ignoring data) based on ""intuition."" I also continued to see people being handed roles only because they were there at the right place, right time.Middle management was the worst I've seen with first-time managers who had little understanding of how they should serve their team. There was no trust between my team and my manager although we got along well outside of work. With this type of management, there was no accountability into one's work and very little (if at all) individual goals.Dara's All Hands were usually inspirational, but I rarely felt proud about my work. I wasn't challenged and felt like I was wasting my time, not being able to contribute in a more meaningful way. My skills and experience wasn't put into good use.All of my coworkers are miserable in their roles and feels stuck. I pray that they will be able to dig themselves out of this hole and find something more engaging. The benefit was also SO BAD and management continued to ignore and delay a proper response despite MONTHS of effort from team members across the US to bring this topic to the forefront.

Uber could really go places. But the company is its own worst enemy.Quality work is not rewarded. It's not even encouraged. The focus is on how fast can you turn out a product; not how good of a product can you turn out. Other departments may be different, but I doubt it. The ""just-throw-something-together-quickly"" mentality permeates many departments I have interacted with. Most people on my team are just waiting for the IPO and the post-IPO waiting period, and then they will cash out and move on for this very reason. You can't treat smart, innovative people like piece-work factory workers and expect them to stick around.To HR: You're not as smart as you think you are. That is not to say you are not smart; It's to say that you think employees are naive and easily-manipulated Kool-Aid-drinkers. And, oh, you love your Kool-Aid. Your cheerleading sessions are impressive. Varsity-worthy. I'm all for positivity and pep talks but in organizations that want to innovate, positivity needs to be tempered with a tolerance for healthy challenge and conflict. I'm not talking about being mean or demanding here; I'm talking about allowing a safe environment for people to present dissenting opinions and different ways of doing things, without managers becoming defensive or bashing you for not being a Pollyanna. For all their talk of diversity and inclusion, diverse opinions are not welcome at Uber. (At least not in my department. I would hope in mission-critical product operations dissension for invention is enouraged.)Innovation only applies to the high-profile products (Elevate, autonomous vehicles, app updates.) Any department that is not in a direct consumer-facing or transportation product development role gives lip service to innovation, but are stuck in archaic ways of doing things, which I find quite odd for a tech company. Despite this, employees in these departments are killing it with creativity with what they have to work with. The phrase there is ""with what they have to work with.""The reason I put flex and unlimited PTO as both a pro and a con is because it's sort of a mirage, or a shell game. If you work a weekend day, you can take a week day off, ""if"" you don't have any work to do, or you can ""flex"" and get your work done another time. Well, there are too many meetings and too much ambiguity and too much work and too much lack of direction to allow for any efficient work processes at all. I know PTO and work/life balance is different based on department and roles. But much of the overwork could be eliminated with thoughtful processes and clear objectives and, frankly, competent management. Honestly, sometimes with managers it's like the blind leading the seeing.Many of the reviews mention that this is a ""startup,"" which they use to excuse the ambiguity, haphazard processes, and chaos. (And make not mistake, it is chaotic here.) You can't call a company that is a decade old and has 12,000 global employees a startup. It's time for Uber to grow up. After ten years, it's time to figure out plans, procedures, and processes for each department. And hire managers with mature mindsets. (I don't mean ""old"" mindsets; I mean mature mental processes.) Many managers here run around like headless chickens. (Some managers, however, are quite competent and effective, but they are the rarity.) Most people on my team, even if they like working for Uber, are frustrated in their job because they are not given proper time to develop quality products and ideas.Managers (again, only speaking for my department here) are quick to throw some employees under the bus, while coddling others. Favoritism reigns supreme.So, with so many ""cons,"" why am I still at Uber? No, I don't think I'm masochistic (although I am beginning to question this the longer I remain here.) I am hoping against hope that after the IPO that shareholders will put pressure on the company to change its ways and mature into the organization it is capable of becoming (er, I hope it is capable of becoming a great organization, anyway). And that includes a path to profitability. The company has made positive ""for show"" strides post-Travis, but only because the company was forced to in order to get its house in order for the IPO. Without outside media pressure and the public comments of some previous employees, I doubt the company, internally, would have been motivated to change on its own. Everything now is a show for IPO. What the company turns into after that will tell the real story of what the company is, or is not, made of.",11,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P281.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Mar 6, 2019","""Excellent""",5,Former Employee - Community Operations Specialist in Hyderabad (India),"Values, Culture, Ethics, Friendly, No dress Code",There's nothing bad about Uber.,0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Company-Reviews-E575263_P281.htm?sort.sortType=RD&sort.ascending=true,Uber" Mar 6, 2019","""A company that moves people""",5,"Current Employee - Software Engineer in Sí£o Paulo, Sí£o Paulo (Brazil)","Working at Uber you feel that you have been select to a revolution, to change the way people move in the world.

Planning and architecture is a focus point and democratic: anyone can suggest new initiatives, but these need to be written down clearly and send out to (pretty much) the whole eng org. This means thereäó»s a firehouse of information on whatäó»s going on and even for experienced people like myself, I found my learning accelerate, seeing how other engineers attacked problems.Finally, the reason I enjoy working at Uber over other top places like Facebook is autonomy and impact.
